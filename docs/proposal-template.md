# Introduction

A 2D, grid based, strategy, and dating sim. This game will use a grid based movement system for battles, use dice rolls for attacking, and be in 2D animation. 

# Anticipated Technologies

* Godot
* Github
* C#

# Method/Approach

Agile

# Estimated Timeline

split the project into roughly 3 areas, map, characters, and combat. Getting the grid-based system will probably take 2-3 weeks. 

Designing characters in terms of gameplay will probably take a week to get the basics set up, with an additional 2 weeks to set up interactions such as combat. Inventory might add a week or two.

Character design and writing I'm honestly not sure of, and would probably take a while.

Then we would probably set up maps and gameplay challenges, 2-3 weeks to get a base set up, and then another week or 2 to refine.

Obviously these things can be worked on concurrently, so some things will be going at the same time.

# Anticipated Problems

Problems would primarily be inexperience with Godot and C#, as well as possible time constraints due to other classes.
